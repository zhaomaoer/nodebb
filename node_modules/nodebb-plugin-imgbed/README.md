nodebb-plugin-imgbed
====================

Embeds images into a post with just an image url.

This plugin parses links that are image urls and changes them into markdown-parseable text.

Requirements:
------------------
[nodebb-plugin-markdown](https://community.nodebb.org/topic/77/nodebb-plugin-markdown-markdown-parser) or a similar markdown parser must be installed and enabled


Upcoming
------------------
* Support for having no markdown parser, or alternate image embedding syntax
