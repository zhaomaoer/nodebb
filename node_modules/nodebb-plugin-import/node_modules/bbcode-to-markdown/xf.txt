As I'm sure many of you have heard by now a new client is in development. This isn't an update to the old client; this is a complete re-write from ground up. The code is far enough that I feel comfortable posting the progress of it, and answering any questions you may have, and taking feature requests.

[align=center:16kwo1g2][b:16kwo1g2]Some common questions[/b:16kwo1g2][/align:16kwo1g2]
[align=center:16kwo1g2][/align:16kwo1g2]
[b:16kwo1g2]Why is it taking so long?[/b:16kwo1g2]
[list:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]That would be because I am currently attending a University for a degree in Computer Engineering. What little free time I have not studying, sleeping, doing homework, working, or relaxing, is spent on FOG. Basically not a lot of time can go into the new client. However, I'm currently on semester break, a glorious 1 month of nothing to do besides FOG development, so you can expect exponentially faster progress.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]I get paid / have made $0 to do this, and I still have to pay for my tuition. Believe me when I say if I could work on FOG full time I would.[/*:m:16kwo1g2][/list:u:16kwo1g2]
[b:16kwo1g2]Why the rewrite?[/b:16kwo1g2]
[list:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]It's sorely needed. The legacy client is extremely difficult to recompile, and as such no updates have been done since its official release.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]The ability to make custom modules is insanely hard. It is not moduler, and as such much of the same code is repeated multiple times.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Cross-platform support. The legacy client relied on windows-only security methods to handle the security of active directory passwords. The new one uses cross-platform alternatives that are more secure.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]It allows us to easily make new modules. A single module can be as short as 35 lines of code instead of several hundred.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Windows 8 compatibility. Many of the modules have been broken since the introduction of Windows 7/8.[/*:m:16kwo1g2][/list:u:16kwo1g2]
[b:16kwo1g2]What are some of the new features (subject to change)?[/b:16kwo1g2]
[list:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]The ability to compile a new installer for the client straight from the web portal. (You update the source files, go to the web portal and hit "Compile & Update" which gives you new binaries and updates already deployed clients ).[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Security has gone through the roof. We have SSL support, use RSA and AES encryption, and we detect any client-tampering.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]There is another experimental feature in the works: event-driven modules. Rather then checking in every X seconds for new tasks an encrypted concurrent connection is formed between the server and client, allowing the server to notify the client of a task immediately. This would allow for instant snapin deployment, cloning, e.t.c. Essentially it makes the client use less cpu on the computer and become more responsive.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]One of my favorites. In-place upgrades. If you upload an update file to FOG the clients will download and apply it without needing a reboot.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]User-level tasks. We actually run 2 services now. A system-level one for things like installing software and a user-level one for tasks that are user-specific.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Remote shell code execution.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Software inventory. Get a report of what software is on a host from the web portal.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Cross platform support. We are actually waiting on Microsoft for this one. The .NET framework has gone open source (MIT license), and is being ported to OSX and Linux by Microsoft. This will allow us to use the same core libraries across all platforms.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Logs. I consider this a new feature because of how radically they have changed. The fog.log is more organized, split up, and contains more useful debugging information.[/*:m:16kwo1g2]
[*:16kwo1g2]Notifications! This one is small yet huge. Our goal is to make this service as professional as possible. We support users providing their own logos, banners, and company names to modify the tray & notifications as needed. Below is a sample of what reboot-notification looks like (the FOG banner & references are swapped out with your company's)[/*:m:16kwo1g2][/list:u:16kwo1g2]
